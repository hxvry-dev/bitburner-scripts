# TODO.md

Things to work on for the `bitburner-scripts` repo.

## Todo

### Batcher
- [ ] Implement method for `Batcher` to auto-root servers, so it can be a set-and-forget.
  - [ ] Optimize/simplify the `batching` algorithm.

### Maybe BatchManager.ts?

- [ ] Allow `Batcher`/`Manager` to upgrade/purchase new p-servers.
- [ ] Allow `Batcher`/`Manager` to purchase Hack Programs (Ex. BruteSSH.exe)
    - [ ] Have the `Batcher`/`Manager` script purchase `Formulas.exe` automatically.

## In Progress
